1. For Petals against fruit, there seems to be somewhat of a random, postive correlation between the two variables. The more petals, the more fruit producing the plant. (assets/petals.png)

For Internode against fruit, there appears a more random relationship. (assets/Internode.png)

For Sepal against fruit, from 2-3 and 4-5 Sepal, there is a postive relationship with fruit. There is a break in the graph from 3-4 with no observations falling in that gap. (assets/Sepal.png)

2. Petals: The histogram is left skewed, so non-normal distrubtion. (assets/Petals hist.png)

Internode: The histogram is neither left or right skewed and is non-normal. It peaks when the internode reaches 25 and 28 then drops drastically at 29. It waves back up at 30 and 31. (assets/Internode hist.png)

Sepal: This histogram is highly right skewed with many of the observations falling from 2-3 sepals. The frequency of 4-5 sepals is much less. (assets/Sepal hist.png)

Fruit: There is somewhat of a vague normal distribution where most of the observataions fall in the 7.4 value and the rest taper off before and after that value. Although, there is a spike at 8 fruit, which makes the graph not entirely a normal distribution. (assets/Fruit hist.png)

3. Done

4. All the observations seem to have a similiar distribution with max/min's comparable to eachother. Bract I and Bract II have skewness based on the boxes, which can be seen by the median falling toward the beginning of the box. There really is not much skewness on any of the categories' whiskers.
